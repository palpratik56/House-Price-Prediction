## Project Overview

The **House Price Prediction** project is a straightforward implementation of a linear regression model designed to predict house prices based on various features. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding regression analysis and machine learning in Python.

## Features

- Predicts house prices using a linear regression model.
- Easy-to-understand implementation suitable for beginners.
- Data preprocessing techniques applied for better model performance.
- Visualization of the model's performance through plots.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- **Version Control**: Git

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various features related to house attributes, such as:

- Size of the house (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location
- Age of the house
- And other relevant features

You can find the dataset in the `data` folder of this repository or download it from [Kaggle's House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Installation and Setup

To set up the House Price Prediction project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/palpratik56/House-Price-Prediction.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd House-Price-Prediction
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download any necessary datasets**: Ensure that the house price dataset is available in the `data` folder as specified in the project files.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Open your Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.
2. Load the notebook or script files included in the project.
3. Follow the instructions in the code to execute each section step-by-step, ensuring that all dependencies and datasets are correctly configured.
