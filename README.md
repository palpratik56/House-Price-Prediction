## Project Overview

The **House Price Prediction** project is a straightforward implementation of a linear regression model designed to predict house prices based on various features. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding regression analysis and machine learning in Python.

## Features

- Predicts house prices using a linear regression model.
- Easy-to-understand implementation suitable for beginners.
- Data preprocessing techniques applied for better model performance.
- Visualization of the model's performance through plots.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- **Version Control**: Git

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 13 various features related to house attributes, bwlow is an overview of the features
